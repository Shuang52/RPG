Just in case it's not working:

Objects "Ground" "Elevated" and "Stairs" and Player need to have a corresponding tag

Dust2 has script:
	Grid.cs
	
AssaultBlue has scripts:
	BaseCharacterClass.cs
	AssaultClass.cs
	Raycast.cs
	CharacterMovement2.cs
	PathFinder.cs
	
Addition Script:
	Tile.cs

Extra Note:
I only placed it on the assault class here, but i tested the Pathfinder with different 
variables and it is working, so it will probably be fairly easy to implement it on other
class types.
